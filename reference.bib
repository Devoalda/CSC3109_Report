	abstract = {Primary {CNS} tumours refer to a heterogeneous group of tumours arising from cells within the {CNS}, and can be benign or malignant. Malignant primary brain tumours remain among the most difficult cancers to treat, with a 5 year overall survival no greater than 35\%. The most common malignant primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Recent advances in molecular biology have improved understanding of glioma pathogenesis, and several clinically significant genetic alterations have been described. A number of these ({IDH}, 1p/19q codeletion, H3 Lys27Met, and {RELA}-fusion) are now combined with histology in the revised 2016 {WHO} classification of {CNS} tumours. It is likely that understanding such molecular alterations will contribute to the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of brain tumours. This progress in genomics, along with significant advances in cancer and {CNS} immunology, has defined a new era in neuro-oncology and holds promise for diagntic and therapeutic improvement. The challenge at present is to translate these advances into effective treatments. Current efforts are focused on developing molecular targeted therapies, immunotherapies, gene therapies, and novel drug-delivery technologies. Results with single-agent therapies have been disappointing so far, and combination therapies seem to be required to achieve a broad and durable antitumour response. Biomarker-targeted clinical trials could improve efficiencies of therapeutic development.},

	abstract = {Data augmentation is a popular technique which helps improve generalization capabilities of deep neural networks, and can be perceived as implicit regularization. It plays a pivotal role in scenarios in which the amount of high-quality ground-truth data is limited, and acquiring new examples is costly and time-consuming. This is a very common problem in medical image analysis, especially tumor delineation. In this paper, we review the current advances in data-augmentation techniques applied to magnetic resonance images of brain tumors. To better understand the practical aspects of such algorithms, we investigate the papers submitted to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge ({BraTS} 2018 edition), as the {BraTS} dataset became a standard benchmark for validating existent and emerging brain-tumor detection and segmentation techniques. We verify which data augmentation approaches were exploited and what was their impact on the abilities of underlying supervised learners. Finally, we highlight the most promising research directions to follow in order to synthesize high-quality artificial brain-tumor examples which can boost the generalization abilities of deep models.},

	abstract = {The use of various kinds of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques for examining brain tissue has increased significantly in recent years, and manual investigation of each of the resulting images can be a time-consuming task. This paper presents an automatic brain-tumor diagnosis system that uses a {CNN} for detection, classification, and segmentation of glioblastomas; the latter stage seeks to segment tumors inside glioma {MRI} images. The structure of the developed multi-unit system consists of two stages. The first stage is responsible for tumor detection and classification by categorizing brain {MRI} images into normal, high-grade glioma (glioblastoma), and low-grade glioma. The uniqueness of the proposed network lies in its use of different levels of features, including local and global paths. The second stage is responsible for tumor segmentation, and skip connections and residual units are used during this step. Using 1800 images extracted from the {BraTS} 2017 dataset, the detection and classification stage was found to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99\%. The segmentation stage was then evaluated using the Dice score, specificity, and sensitivity. The results showed that the suggested deep-learning-based system ranks highest among a variety of different strategies reported in the literature.},

    abstract = { Purpose To develop a fully automated device- and sequence-independent convolutional neural network (CNN) for reliable and high-throughput labeling of heterogeneous, unstructured MRI data. Materials and Methods Retrospective, multicentric brain MRI data (2179 patients with glioblastoma, 8544 examinations, 63 327 sequences) from 249 hospitals and 29 scanner types were used to develop a network based on ResNet-18 architecture to differentiate nine MRI sequence types, including T1-weighted, postcontrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, susceptibility-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, diffusion-weighted (low and high b value), and gradient-recalled echo T2*-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast-related images. The two-dimensional-midsection images from each sequence were allocated to training or validation (approximately 80\%) and testing (approximately 20\%) using a stratified split to ensure balanced groups across institutions, patients, and MRI sequence types. The prediction accuracy was quantified for each sequence type, and subgroup comparison of model performance was performed using χ2 tests. Results On the test set, the overall accuracy of the CNN (ResNet-18) ensemble model among all sequence types was 97.9\% (95\% CI: 97.6, 98.1), ranging from 84.2\% for susceptibility-weighted images (95\% CI: 81.8, 86.6) to 99.8\% for T2-weighted images (95\% CI: 99.7, 99.9). The ResNet-18 model achieved significantly better accuracy compared with ResNet-50 despite its simpler architecture (97.9\% vs 97.1\%; P ≤ .001). The accuracy of the ResNet-18 model was not affected by the presence versus absence of tumor on the two-dimensional-midsection images for any sequence type (P > .05). Conclusion The developed CNN (www.github.com/neuroAI-HD/HD-SEQ-ID) reliably differentiates nine types of MRI sequences within multicenter and large-scale population neuroimaging data and may enhance the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of clinical and research neuroradiologic workflows.

abstract="The application of deep learning (DL) models to the decoding of cognitive states from whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is often hindered by the small sample size and high dimensionality of these datasets. Especially, in clinical settings, where patient data are scarce. In this work, we demonstrate that transfer learning represents a solution to this problem. Particularly, we show that a DL model, which has been previously trained on a large openly available fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project, outperforms a model variant with the same architecture, but which is trained from scratch, when both are applied to the data of a new, unrelated fMRI task. The pre-trained DL model variant is able to correctly decode 67.51{\%} of the cognitive states from a test dataset with 100 individuals, when fine-tuned on a dataset of the size of only three subjects.",
