	abstract = {With the booming demand of indoor position information, Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra-Wide-Band etc.) are investigated to construct Indoor Positioning System ({IPS}). Among these wireless signals, {UWB} (Ultra-Wide-Band) is recognized as the most promising technology to construct {IPS} with decimeter-level positioning accuracy. However, there are various objects in indoor environments, {UWB} signals might be reﬂected by these surrounding objects. These None-Line-Of-Sight ({NLOS}) signals will induce additional errors to the distance measurements between the anchor and agent. Therefore, {NLOS}/{LOS} (Line-Of-Sight) signals classiﬁcation should be carried out for identifying the {NLOS} reception. In {UWB} based {IPS}, the distance information is extracted through the Channel Impulse Response ({CIR}) waveforms. {NLOS} reception will lead to different {CIR} waveforms compared with that from the {LOS} signal, this difference could be characterized for {NLOS}/{LOS} signals classiﬁcation. However, the hardware circuits, signal transmitting path and the {NLOS} reception will bring about noises to the {CIR} waveforms, which might inﬂuence the signal type identiﬁcation. Motivated by this problem, in this letter, a reversible transformation method was proposed for de-nosing the {CIR} data, and a Conventional Neural Network ({CNN}) was employed to identify the {NLOS} signal. Raw and de-noised {CIR} dataset were both input to the {CNN} for assessing the effect of the de-noising method. With dataset collected from seven different sites, the results showed that the reversible transformation method was able to increase the Signal Noise Ratio ({SNR}) values of these {CIR} datasets. After the de-noising, the {CNN} performed higher classiﬁcation accuracy with less convolutional layers. Moreover, the de-noising operation brought about higher {NLOS} signal identiﬁcation accuracy increase than that of {LOS} signals.},

	abstract = {Non-Line-of-Sight ({NLoS}) propagation condition is a crucial factor affecting the precision of the localization in the Ultra-Wideband ({UWB}) Indoor Positioning System ({IPS}). Numerous supervised Machine Learning ({ML}) approaches have been applied for {NLoS} identification to improve the accuracy of the {IPS}. However, it is difficult for existing {ML} approaches to maintain a high classification accuracy when the database contains a small number of {NLoS} signals and a large number of Line-of-Sight ({LoS}) signals. The inaccurate localization of the target node caused by this small number of {NLoS} signals can still be problematic. To solve this issue, we propose feature-based Gaussian Distribution ({GD}) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution ({GGD}) {NLoS} detection algorithms. By employing our detection algorithm for the imbalanced dataset, a classification accuracy of \$96.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$98.0{\textbackslash}\%\$ can be achieved. We also compared the proposed algorithm with the existing cutting-edge such as Support-Vector-Machine ({SVM}), Decision Tree ({DT}), Naive Bayes ({NB}), and Neural Network ({NN}), which can achieve an accuracy of \$92.6{\textbackslash}\%\$, \$92.8{\textbackslash}\%\$, \$93.2{\textbackslash}\%\$, and \$95.5{\textbackslash}\%\$, respectively. The results demonstrate that the {GGD} algorithm can achieve high classification accuracy with the imbalanced dataset. Finally, the proposed algorithm can also achieve a higher classification accuracy for different ratios of {LoS} and {NLoS} signals which proves the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become the state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications such as patient-specific ECG classification, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the "Big Data" scale in order to prevent the well-known "overfitting" problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical background. We will present their state-of-the-art performances and conclude with focusing on some major properties.},
